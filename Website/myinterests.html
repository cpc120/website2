          <h2>Video Games</h2>
          <article>
            I have been playing video games for while. I first started playing
            Pokemon and Super Mario on the Gameboy Advanced. I played on various
            consoless such as the Playstation and Xbox. Since 2020, I have
            become a PC gamer, playing various FPS games such as Valorant and
            CS. I also enjoy playing a lot of story-driven games like the
            Witcher 3 when I want to solo game. Gaming has made a pivotal impact
            on my life, as I have met and foster many friendships from it.

          <h2>Music</h2>
          <article>
            Before video games, there was music. Growing up, I was always
            surrouded by music, in and out of my home. I first started taking
            piano lessons in my younger years but felt the piano "wasn't cool".
            So I switched to guitar. I am semi-self taught, meaning I took
            lessons for a short time then stopped. My friends and I used to have
            a cover band, and I was the lead guitarist. I still play guitar to
            this day, but casaully.
